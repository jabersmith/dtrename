This is a placeholder, for now.

When/if I ever distribute this in tarball form, it would include a
'configure' file, and all the other autoconf-generated files that
support the common "./configure; make; make install" compile/install
flow.

But for now, I'm only publishing this as a source project, and refuse
to check those generated files in as source.  So that flow needs to
be proceeded by "autoreconf --install", and the environment where
it's built needs to have a working autoconf/automake.
